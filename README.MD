## **Description**

This application was developed during the [course Ignite](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/ignite).
The application was created using Expo, and CSS-in-JS (styled-components) was used for component styling. <br /><br />
The application allows users to create teams for playing games. Users can effortlessly create groups and divide them into two teams, while also adding players to each team.<br />
